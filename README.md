# Developed a Predictive Model for balancing an Assembly Line
This study investigates multiple machine learning methodologies that an operations manager can use to allocate appropriate tasks to suitable workstations efficiently. The motivation of the study is to help operations managers device strategies to improve the efficiency of their operations in assembly lines. With the use of predictive models, our goal is to help them not only understand but also evaluate the capability and performance of each workstation and assign tasks to them accordingly. Within the scope of the study, models have been developed to predict the completion times of incoming tasks so that an apt workstation can be scheduled well in advance for the planned tasks to improve production line efficiency. In addition to this, using machine learning models, various factors, and measures impacting the performance of the production line have been assessed. Also highlighted in this study are the possible features that are missing and could have been influential in this analysis. By collaborating with a structural building components manufacturer and using their data, we build and assess various analytics models and highlight some of those models which help derive quantifiable insights that operations managers can incorporate to improve their existing processes.
